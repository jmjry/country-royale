## Testing 

Testing was undertaken at the start, during and after finishing my project. To complete my testing I used the [Google Chrome DevTool](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/), a spreadsheet to track tests, validators (as soon below) and reviews by peers (as seen in the credits).

### Feature testing 
* Each feature was tested for responsiveness on desktop, tablet and mobile. If the feature responded correctly then it was marked green on my spreadsheet.
* All features that had links were tested to ensure the link would work when a user click on it. All of the links passed the test and was marked green.
* All form fields were tested to ensure the correct information was submitted. The form fields passed the test and was marked green. 

### Responsiveness testing 

* All responsiveness testing was done in the Google Chrome devtool. As I designed my website for desktop, I used media queries across the site to ensure that the website remained responsive at widths all the way down to 320px. 
* After my testing I decided that in the future I will initially design for mobile and then work the responsiveness up.

### Validator testing 

* HTML 
  * No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html) 

 * CSS
   * No erros were found when passing through the official [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

 ## Credits:
 
 * To ensure my CSS code was formatted correctly, I ran it through a formatter which can be found here: [CSS Code Formatter](https://www.freeformatter.com/css-beautifier.html#ad-output)
 * To ensure my HTML code was formatted correctly, I ran it through a formatter which can be found here: [HTML Code Formatter](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html)

### Content 

### Code 

* As a go to reasource hub I used [W3S Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp).
* To create my responsive picture examples I used [ami.responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is).
* When stuck on a development issue, I checked [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) to see if other developers had the same problems.
