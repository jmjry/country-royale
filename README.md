## Testing 

Testing was undertaken at the start, during and after finishing my project. To complete my testing I used the [Google Chrome DevTool](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/), a spreadsheet to track tests, validators (as seen below) and reviews by peers (as seen in the credits).

### Feature testing 
* Each feature was tested for responsiveness on desktop, tablet and mobile. If the feature responded correctly then it was marked green on my spreadsheet.
* All features that had links were tested to ensure the link would work when a user click on it. All of the links passed the test and was marked green.
* All form fields were tested to ensure the correct information was submitted. The form fields passed the test and was marked green. 

### Responsiveness testing 

* All responsiveness testing was done in the Google Chrome devtool. As I designed my website for desktop, I used media queries across the site to ensure that the website remained responsive at widths all the way down to 320px. 
* After my testing I decided that in the future I will initially design for mobile and then work the responsiveness up.

### Validator testing 

* HTML 
  * No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html) 

 * CSS
   * No erros were found when passing through the official [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)  
 
 ### Accessibility testing 
 
 ### Known Bugs 
 
 * During the testing of my project, after the removal of radio buttons I noticed that there was no indication for the user when selecting an answer. This has since been fixed but was recorded as a bug during time of testing.
 
 ## Deployment 

### How was this site deployed? 

* Firstly, I opened up country-royale in the GitHub repository and navigated to the Settings tab. After selecting Settings, I proceeded to click on Pages.
* Following this, I selected Master Branch from the source section.
* After selecting Master Branch, the page will now automatically refresh to display a succesful deployment. 
* Any future changes pushed to the same Master Branch will now take effect on the live page (after a few minutes).
